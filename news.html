    <p><b><strong><em>The 2025 Pahalgam attack </em></strong></b> was a terrorist attack on tourists by at least three armed terrorists near Pahalgam in India's Jammu and Kashmir in which <mark>26 civilians were killed</mark> on <mark>22 April 2025</mark>. The militants targeted Hindu tourists, though a Christian tourist and a local Muslim were also killed. The attackers, armed with M4 carbines and AK-47s, entered the <b>Baisaran Valley</b>, a famous tourist spot, through the surrounding forests. This incident is considered the deadliest attack on civilians in India since the 2008 Mumbai attacks.</p>

The Resistance Front (TRF), a proxy of the Pakistan-based Islamist UN-designated terrorist group Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT),initially claimed responsibility for the attack twice, on both the day of the attack and the next day. TRF released a statement that the attack was in opposition to non-local settlement in the region resulting from the abolition of the special status of Kashmir. After a few days, TRF denied its involvement in the attack. Previously, TRF has claimed responsibility for several attacks in Indian-administered Kashmir targeting religious minorities.

The militants singled out the men and asked for their religion before shooting the Hindu and Christian tourists. The attackers also asked some tourists to recite the Islamic kalima, a Muslim declaration of faith, to identify non-Muslims. Of the 26 people killed, 25 were tourists, and one was a local Muslim pony ride operator who tried to wrestle a gun from the attackers. The tourists included several newlywed couples, and the men were shot point-blank in front of their wives.
<br>
In retaliation Indian forces launched <mark> OPERATION MAHADEV </mark> to identify and neutralize the terrorists. On 28 July 2025 three perpetrators were killed.</p>
